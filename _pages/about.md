<!-- # About Me -->

Hello, I’m Vicente. I am a PhD student at Université Grenoble Alpes, affiliated with the Morpheo Team at Inria Grenoble and the STROBE Laboratory at Inserm. My research is focused on functional exploration of human respiration through thoracic image processing and statistical modeling.

I bring a multidisciplinary background that bridges mechatronics, robotics, and advanced manufacturing with medical image analysis and applied mathematics. Before moving to France, I gained professional experience in the automotive industry and as a professor, which honed my problem-solving skills and technical expertise.

During my Master’s studies in France, I specialized in signal and image processing, and I am now extending this foundation in my PhD to develop multimodal computational frameworks for the study and characterization of human respiration. My work starts with CT scan processing to quantitatively characterize human respiration, which can be leveraged for pathology identification, severity assessment, physiological biomarker extraction, and other clinical and research applications.

I am passionate about combining engineering, mathematics, and informatics to create tools that translate complex biomedical data into actionable insights
